**Kill the antivirus for a sec**—it’s false flaggin the crack.

## Why this exists:
VITBPL wifi is actual trash, bro. It shoulda been dead or sum, speeds so slow, your WhatsApp texts show up next semester 😭🙏, and disconnects every 2 minutes like it’s powered by hopes and prayers 💯.  
So, I made this bot to get rid of their shit restrictions and give you usable internet forever.

## How to use this bot:
### 1. Install CyberGhost VPN (if you don’t have it):
Don’t worry!  
The bot has it bundled in the `.exe`, just install it from there. *(VITBPL blocked the CyberGhost Page LMFAO).*

### 2. Run the bot:
- Open the bot `fuckVITBPL.exe` file.
- Type `1` to start the process.  
  **IMPORTANT:** Disable your antivirus temporarily—it flags the crack part of the process. *(This is safe, don’t worry.)*

### 3. Sit back and chill:
The bot will automatically create a new CyberGhost Premium account for you with a 1-day trial.

### 4. Tweak the VPN settings:
- Once the bot is done, open **CyberGhost VPN**.
- Go to **Settings** and change the VPN protocol to **IKEv2** *(you NEED this, or it won’t work properly).*

### 5. Repeat after 1 day:
When the trial runs out, just run the bot again and follow the steps from Step 2.  
**Unlimited reset = unlimited VPN.**

## Note:
If you’re experiencing slow speeds, that’s on the network, and the VPN ain’t gonna do anything, dawg. 💀  
But if sites are throttling your downloads because of VIT’s stupid restrictions, the VPN might help with that. Always use [JDownloader2](https://jdownloader.org/jdownloader2).

## FAQ (because y’all always ask):
**Q: Will I get caught?**  
**A:** Nah, bro. Wifi admins are dumbasses.

**Q: Is this safe?**  
**A:** Yes, but disable your antivirus during setup—it flags the crack as sus.

**Q: Will this work for gaming?**  
**A:** Absolutely, but best to game late at night when the wifi isn’t packed with 1k students. Otherwise, brace for lag 😭🙏.  
However, the EA App doesn’t work with VPN, so here’s your fix: [Fuck_off_EA_App](https://github.com/p0358/Fuck_off_EA_App).

**Q: What if the VPN stops?**  
**A:** Just run the bot again, reset everything, and you’re good to go.

**Q: Why isn’t this working on Windows 10?**  
**A:** It’s a buggy mess on some Windows 10 machines, especially if you’re on updates from 2021 or earlier.

For **“educational purposes”** only—don’t sue me :(. If your wifi cries, that’s on you.
